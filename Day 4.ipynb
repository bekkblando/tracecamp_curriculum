    "    * In distributed computing, code on demand is any technology that sends executable software code from a server computer to a client computer upon request from the client's software. Some well-known examples of the code on demand paradigm on the web are Java applets, Adobe's ActionScript language for the Flash player, and JavaScript.  \n",

    "    * Resource identification in requests: Individual resources are identified in requests, for example using URIs in RESTful Web services. The resources themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are returned to the client. For example, the server could send data from its database as HTML, XML or as JSON—none of which are the server's internal representation."
